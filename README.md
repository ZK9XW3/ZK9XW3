# Hi there 👋

I'm a junior web developer who fell in love with Symfony ! I'm eager to learn more about new tools while working on different projects.

🔐 While working on an app to practice authentication, I'm currently learning to use Docker, CI with Symfony tests.

Next I'd love to learn a front-end framework/library but i still can't decide wich one to choose between Vue.js and React 😅
